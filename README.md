## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing attributes of various songs such as danceability, energy, tempo, and other acoustic features to predict a song's popularity. The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to forecast the success of a song based on these factors.

## Data Source

The dataset is collected from [Spotify API] or [Kaggle] (provide your source). It includes various metrics for each song, such as:
* Acousticness
* Danceability
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Valence
* Tempo
* Duration
* Loudness
* Speechiness


## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
* Scikit-learn for machine learning
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook for code execution


## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model training with various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
* Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine:
* Clone the repository:
    * git clone https://github.com/your-username/Music-popularity-Code-data.git
* Navigate to the project directory:
  * cd Music-popularity-Code-data
* Install the required dependencies:
  * pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Once everything is installed, you can run the project by executing the main script:

python music_popularity_prediction.py
For Jupyter notebooks, simply open Music_Popularity_Prediction.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

## Model Performance
The trained model achieves an accuracy of XX% (replace with your result). Below are some key metrics for model evaluation:

* Precision: XX%
* Recall: XX%
* F1-Score: XX%
the model performs well in identifying popular songs with high accuracy and consistency across different datasets.
